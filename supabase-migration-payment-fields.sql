-- Migration: Add missing payment and business configuration fields
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL editor

-- 1. Add payment configuration fields to businesses table
ALTER TABLE businesses ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ath_movil_enabled boolean DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE businesses ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ath_movil_public_token text;
ALTER TABLE businesses ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ath_movil_private_token text;
ALTER TABLE businesses ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS stripe_enabled boolean DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE businesses ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS stripe_publishable_key text;
ALTER TABLE businesses ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS stripe_secret_key text;
ALTER TABLE businesses ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS deposit_enabled boolean DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE businesses ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS deposit_amount numeric(10,2) DEFAULT 10.00;
ALTER TABLE businesses ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS deposit_policy text DEFAULT 'A deposit is required to confirm your appointment';

-- 2. Add payment tracking fields to appointments table
ALTER TABLE appointments ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS deposit_amount integer; -- in cents
ALTER TABLE appointments ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS total_amount integer;   -- in cents

-- 3. Update payment_status enum to match codebase usage
-- First, check if we need to update the enum
DO $$ 
BEGIN
    -- Add 'completed' status if it doesn't exist (maps to 'succeeded')
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_enum WHERE enumlabel = 'completed' AND enumtypid = 'payment_status'::regtype) THEN
        ALTER TYPE payment_status ADD VALUE 'completed';
    END IF;
END $$;

-- 4. Update payment provider values to match codebase
-- The code uses 'ath_movil' but schema shows 'ath'
-- We'll keep both for compatibility but standardize on 'ath_movil'

-- 5. Add indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_businesses_slug ON businesses(slug);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_businesses_owner_id ON businesses(owner_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_appointments_business_id ON appointments(business_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_appointments_starts_at ON appointments(starts_at);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_appointments_status ON appointments(status);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_payments_business_id ON payments(business_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_payments_external_id ON payments(external_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_payments_provider ON payments(provider);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_services_business_id ON services(business_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_staff_business_id ON staff(business_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_availability_rules_business_id ON availability_rules(business_id);

-- 6. Add policy for anonymous users to read business info (for public booking)
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "public can read business for booking" 
ON businesses 
FOR SELECT 
TO anon 
USING (true);

-- 7. Add policy for anonymous users to read services (for public booking)  
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "public can read services for booking"
ON services
FOR SELECT
TO anon
USING (true);

-- 8. Add policy for service role to manage payments (for webhooks)
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "service role can manage payments"
ON payments
FOR ALL
TO service_role
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

-- 9. Add policy for service role to update appointments (for payment confirmation)
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "service role can update appointments"
ON appointments  
FOR UPDATE
TO service_role
USING (true);

-- 10. Update the appointments table to allow null staff_id in the exclusion constraint
-- This is needed because the current constraint may be too restrictive
-- We'll drop and recreate it to handle null staff_id properly

-- First, let's drop the existing constraint
ALTER TABLE appointments DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS appointments_staff_id_tstzrange_excl;

-- Recreate with better handling of NULL staff_id
-- We need two separate constraints: one for specific staff, one for business-level resources
ALTER TABLE appointments ADD CONSTRAINT appointments_staff_overlap_excl 
EXCLUDE USING gist (
  staff_id WITH =,
  tstzrange(starts_at, ends_at, '[)') WITH &&
) WHERE (staff_id IS NOT NULL);

-- For business-level appointments (staff_id IS NULL), we need to prevent overlaps differently
-- This constraint ensures no overlapping business-level appointments
ALTER TABLE appointments ADD CONSTRAINT appointments_business_overlap_excl
EXCLUDE USING gist (
  business_id WITH =,
  tstzrange(starts_at, ends_at, '[)') WITH &&
) WHERE (staff_id IS NULL);

-- 11. Add helpful views for reporting (optional)
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW appointment_details AS
SELECT 
  a.*,
  s.name as service_name,
  s.duration_min,
  s.price_cents as service_price_cents,
  st.display_name as staff_name,
  b.name as business_name,
  b.timezone as business_timezone,
  COALESCE(p.status, 'pending') as payment_status,
  p.provider as payment_provider,
  p.amount_cents as payment_amount_cents
FROM appointments a
JOIN services s ON a.service_id = s.id
JOIN businesses b ON a.business_id = b.id
LEFT JOIN staff st ON a.staff_id = st.id
LEFT JOIN payments p ON p.meta->>'appointment_id' = a.id::text AND p.status = 'completed';

-- Grant access to the view
GRANT SELECT ON appointment_details TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON appointment_details TO service_role;

COMMENT ON TABLE businesses IS 'Business profiles with payment configuration';
COMMENT ON TABLE payments IS 'Payment transactions for appointments (Stripe, ATH MÃ³vil)';
